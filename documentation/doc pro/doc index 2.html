                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design
                        web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of 
                        Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link 
                        between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text 
                        document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply 
                        designed language intended to simplify the process of making 
                        web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web 
                        pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently 
                        of the HTML that makes up each web page. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) 
                            text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text 
                            accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
                            The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done 
                            on the text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, 
                            fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website 
                            look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how 
                            it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and 
                            understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation 
                            of an HTML document.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        Html and css both are used in the designing a web page. 
                        Html uses the tags and attributes to fill the content of 
                        the web page. It is use to enter the text format messages,
                        background images, logos, hyperlinks, etc in the web page 
                        that we created.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The CSS use to add the styles to the web page contents. 
                        Here style refers to text font, text style, text color, 
                        text background color, etc. it can be used in three way 
                        or three types. Inline, internal, external are the 3 types 
                        CSS. By using the above types we can work with both HTML and 
                        CSS
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can use the same attributes in HTML also but there are some 
                        drawbacks in it. When the code is more, maintain the style for 
                        each line will be quite complicated. We may miss some details in 
                        it, which will lead to an error eventually. For this reason we 
                        write the style coding in the CSS code in order for more efficient.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        In HTML we uses certain elements, tags,etc. first see about block 
                        elements which uses header tags < h > and paragraph tags < p >. The 
                        header tags use for heading purpose and the paragraph tags use for 
                        writing paragraph contents. Next we see format tags which is used 
                        for the format of the content. It use bold < b >, italic < i >, 
                        underline < u >, superscript < sup > and subscript < sub >. Next we 
                        can see about anchor tag which represent as < a >. The main purpose
                        of the anchor tag is to add the hyperlink in the HTML program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are also some other tags like image tag and list tag. 
                        In image tag we can use image as we want to. Like we can use the 
                        image for the background purpose, for logo, etc. The image tag I 
                        represent as < img >. The next tag that we going to see is list tags. 
                        The list tags can be divided into three types namely ordered, unordered 
                        and definition list. The tag use for list is < li >. The tag used for 
                        ordered list is < ol > and the tag use for unordered list is < ul > 
                        and the tag used for definition list is < dl >.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the important topic in the HTML is tables and form element. 
                        Here in this topic we can discuss about how the table can be formed 
                        and how can we create a basic form etc. First we discuss about table 
                        structure. In HTML Table is a representation of data arranged in rows 
                        and columns. The most important one is the < table > tag which is the main 
                        container of the table. Table is divided into rows and each row is 
                        further divided into data cells The letters td stand for "table data," 
                        which is the data cell's content. < tr > tag is used to create table
                        rows. < th > and < td > tags can be used to create columns. To continue 
                        with we discuss about column span and row span. Colspan and rowspan are 
                        the table attributes which are used to specify the no. of columns or rows 
                        a cell should span. These attributes have a numeric value. Colspan span 
                        the cell in horizontal direction and rowspan span the cell in vertical 
                        direction. You will use the colspan attribute if you want to merge two 
                        or more columns into a single column. Similarly you will use rowspan if 
                        you want to merge two or more rows.

                        There are three types of CSS. Inline CSS Internal CSS External CSS. 
                        These are the important types in CSS. Inline css is the css that is 
                        written inside the opening tag of the HTML element using style property. 
                        In internal css,with the help of  style tag css is written in the head section of 
                        the HTML document and property defined in the internal css is applicable 
                        to the elements in the entire HTML document.In inline css , property once 
                        defined in the style tag can be reused for all tag in the entire HTML 
                        document.In External CSS  a .css file is created  in the project 
                        directory and is linked to the HTML document with the help of link tag. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next concept is called as selectors. There are several types of selector 
                        is available in CSS lets see one by one. The tag selector applies to specific 
                        HTML tags, The selector consists simply of the tag name as it appears in the 
                        HTML source, but without the angle brackets {}. Id selector selects the id attribute 
                        of  element to select a specific element. Id selector written with the hash character 
                        (#),. It is always unique within the page. Class selector is formatted as a period (.) 
                        character followed by the name of the class.Advantages of  class selectors is,  it selects 
                        all elements with that class attribute so that unique CSS declarations can be applied to 
                        those specific elements without affecting other elements on the page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        CSS property is mainly used to change the style of the text program that has been 
                        enter in the HTML. The style refers to the color, text, font, box property like 
                        width and height, display and at last background property. In CSS, the color property 
                        determines the color of text and text decorations. The color property accepts any CSS 
                        color value.CSS color value having the following property. Color- property is used to 
                        set the color of a text. Direction- property is used to set the text direction. Text-indent 
                        property is used to indent the text of a paragraph. Text-align property is used to align 
                        the text of a document. Text-decoration property is used to underline, overline, and 
                        strikethrough text.  Text-transform property is used to capitalize text or convert 
                        text to uppercase or lowercase letters. White-space property is used to control the 
                        flow and formatting of text.
